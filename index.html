    > On GitHub, projects are stored in folder structure that is known as "repository" in sort called "repo".
</h4>
<h3> Clone Commands :</h3>
<h4>

  > Out from Directory: cd .. <br />
  > Check Version: git -v or git --version <br />
  > Clear Terminal: clear <br />
  > ls(lists File): ls <br />
  > Hidden Files: ls -a <br />
  > Clone Link: git clone <-link->
</h4>
<h3> Status Commands :</h3>
<h4>
  > Status: Displays the state of the code. <br>
  > Process: M/U => add => Staged => Commit => Unmodified <br>
  > Check status: git status <br>
  > M: Modified <br>
  > U: Untracked File(New File) <br>

  > : Unmodified
</h4>

    > Commit with Message: git commit -m "Meaning Fll Message" <br>
    > Check history of Commits: git log
</h4>
<h3> Push Command :</h3>
<h4>
    > Push: Upload local repo content to remote repo <br>
    > Push File: git push origin main <br>
    > Shorten Push: git push -u origin main => git push <br>
</h4>
<h3> Init Command :</h3>
<h4>
    > Init: Used to create a new git repo <br>

    > Git Remote add to origin: git remote add origin <-link-> <br>
    > Verify Remote: git remote -v
</h4>
<h3> Branch Command :</h3>
<h4>
    > Multi developers works on single project. <br>
    > Main branch is the default branch. <br>
    > Check Branch: git branch <br>
    > Rename Branch: git branch -M main <br>
    > To navigate other branch: git checkout <-branch name-> <br>
    > Create new branch: git checkout -b <-new branch name-> <br>
    > Delete branch: git branch -d <-branch name->
</h4>
<h3> Merging Code :</h3>
<h4>
    > Compare branches/files: git diff <-branch name-> <br>
    > Merge 2 branches: git merge <-branch name-> <br>
    > By Pull Request(PR), we can also merge in GitHub. <br>
    > Merge Conflicts: An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve the differences in code between two commits.
</h4>
<h3> Pull Command :</h3>
<h4>
    > Pull: Used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content. <br>
    > Pull File: git pull origin main
</h4> 
<h3> Undoing Changes :</h3>
<h4>
    > Case 1: Staged Changes(single) : git reset <-file name-> <br>
    > Case 2: Staged Changes(many) : git reset <br>
    > Case 3: Commited Changes(single) : git reset HEAD~1 <br>
    > Case 4: Commited Changes(many) : git reset <-commit hash->
    > Case 4: Commited Changes(come to original status) : git reset --hard <-commit hash->
</h4>

<h4> Conclusion > Flow: GitHub repo => clone => changes => add => commit => push </h4>
